class Person:
    pass

p = Person()
print(p)


"""
How It Works
We create a new class uding the _class_ statement followed by an indented block which forms the body of the class.
Next we create an object/instance of this class followed by a pair of parentheses. Printing p tells us that we have an instance of the "Person" class in the "__main__" module
The address of the computer memory where your object is stored is also printed
