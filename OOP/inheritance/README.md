## Basic inheritance
- Technically every class we create uses inheritance, all python classes are subclasses of the special class named object. This class provides very little in terms of data and behaviours (the behaviours it does provide are all double-underscore methods intended for internal use only) but it does allow python to treat all objects in the same way
- A __superclass__ or a parent class is a class that is being inherited from. A __subclass__ is a class that is inherting from a superclass
- A subclass is also said to be derived from its parent class or that the subclass extends the parent
